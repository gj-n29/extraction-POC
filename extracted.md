Clarkson (Buy, TP: 4,250p)
1H results
Class act, but stiff headwinds from FX and tariffs
04/08/2025

Clarkson indicated in its record results on 10 March that the record 2025
forward orderbook of US$231m was 2H-weighted. At the AGM on 1 May,
Clarkson stated that US tariff policies, proposed port fees for Chinese vessels,
and ongoing regional conflicts had caused freight rates and asset values to
decline. The volume of US dollar spot negotiations in broking was 7% lower
than anticipated on 10 March. Combined with US dollar weakness, 2025 PBT
was subsequently expected to be £85-95m.

The Clarkson Research 1H25 shipping report, published in early July, noted:
"Our cross-market ClarkSea softened 'only' 5% y-o-y in 1H, but, container
aside (+79% y-o-y), tankers (-33%), bulkers (-31%), and LPG (-22%) all
eased back. Asset market volumes also declined, with S&P volumes down
15% y-o-y and newbuild orders down 54%."

There is limited broking activity in container ship chartering-focused mainly
on newbuilds, second-hand sales, and 20-year charters-so the weakness in
other verticals has a much greater impact than the movement in the ClarkSea
Index. We anticipate Clarkson will use this period to recruit talent from
competitors, grow market share, and further develop its market-leading
product capabilities. However, further US dollar weakness in 2H and the
prolonged period of US tariff changes continue to pose risks, delaying a
return to normalised activity levels.

For 1H 2025, we forecast revenue of £275.9m (-11% YoY), operating profit of
£33.7m (-25% YoY), and PBT of £38.0m (-26% YoY).

In the first 10 weeks of 2025, total system sales rose 2.4%, total orders
increased 0.7%, and LFL sales were up 0.7%. This year, the company aims to
drive growth in collection orders through value-led marketing campaigns.
Other initiatives to support sales include expanding the loyalty trial from
630k to 3m customers, increasing advertising spend, and continuing menu
innovation.
We expect trading to have become more challenging thereafter, due to
warmer YoY weather, Euro24 in the comparatives, and franchisees needing
to offset higher labour costs in 2Q. Additionally, CGA data shows that growth
in the delivery and takeaway market has slowed from 4.9% in 2024 to just
0.6% in the first five months of 2025.
In our view, we are likely to revise down our current assumptions of 2% LFL
sales growth and 50 new store openings in 2025E. Our forecasts already
factor in a 140bps decline in supply chain centre margins this year, which may
help limit any adjustment to PBT forecasts. DOM remains a highly cash-
generative B2B business with low operational gearing. Its shares, trading on
just 12x PE, are near all-time lows-partly reflecting investor caution around
acquisitions, despite the company reaffirming its guardrails for acquiring a
second brand.

Limited surprises expected

The company issued a 1H trading update on 15 July. Organic revenue was flat
YoY (+12% reported), with an improvement in contracted forward revenue
growth in 2Q. The EBITDA margin declined in 1H, but we expect it to recover
in 2H. Given the recent update, we anticipate limited surprises in the
upcoming 1H results.

For the full year, we forecast c.2% organic revenue growth and an EBITDA
margin of 39% (FY24: 41%). With the bidding process now behind it,
management is fully focused on accelerating growth in the core business. We
expect further detail on the performance of the Healthcare and non-
Healthcare segments, the company's revised sales strategy, and the
integration of recent acquisitions.

All eyes on the US

Investor focus will likely be aimed at how the US business is performing, in particular given the increased concerns about the state of the economy. The 24 June statement, which revealed Michael Speakman was stepping down, also indicated that trading was unchanged from the May update. We are modelling a c.8% drop in North American profitability this year-some from FX and some from underlying weakness, especially in residential end markets. We are expecting EME to bounce nicely as a result of weak contracts finishing and self-help measures on costs. We also forecast APAC to move up steadily.

The shares have been somewhat subdued this year after performing strongly in CY24. Valuations remain low, in our view, with a PE of 7.3x for FY25E, a 3.6x EV/EBITDA, and a 12.8% FCF yield.

Rotork (Buy, TP: 400.0p)
1H results

Growth+ focus

The key element of the 1H update will be the order book intake. This was
running up midsingle digits at the 1Q stage (all divisions higher) and
continuation will balance out a near flat revenue performance in 1H after a
modestly lower 1Q, as expected, reflecting the order book phasing a strong
comparator. We forecast 1H EBITA of £80m and revenue of £370m, which
compares to £76.5m and £361m, respectively, for the prior year. Our sense is
that the dynamics of Growth+ are becoming more evident in Rotork's
performance a 10% organic revenue CAGR since 2022 is very clear in this
context - and yet it still has to be fully reflected in the company's valuation,
so we are hoping for more evidence to underpin this profile.

The buyback being underway and an update on the recent Noah acquisition
are further positives. The stock has one of the tightest share price trading
ranges in the sector and the debate we have with investors is what the catalyst
may be to break it out of this range. In our view, Growth+ is now
demonstrably not a plan but a proven reality, and so further evidence can be
that catalyst. In addition, our 400p target price puts the stock on its average
five-year PE, so we are not saying that the stock needs to be rerated, but just
to align with historic norms.

Self-help driven

Half-year results shouldn't contain too much new news, given the detailed
trading update on 8 July. The group has made progress on regaining some
lost market share, as well as making the businesses more profitable. There is
still a long way to go before the group gets anywhere near its targets, but
hopefully market conditions will be less of a headwind in the next 6-12
months than they have been YTD.

The shares have fallen 10% YTD but remain very volatile on a week-by-week
basis. The news of Gavin Slark's departure has impacted some investors'
views, but most are pleased to see a replacement, Pim Vervaat, being
appointed so quickly.
