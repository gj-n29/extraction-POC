*** PROMPT:Does the report indicate this stock is a recommendation to buy, sell or hold?  If so, what is the target price and the rationale for the recommendation?
Here's the breakdown of the report's recommendation and rationale, with page references:

*   **Recommendation:** HOLD / MARKET PERFORM (Page 1)
*   **Target Price:** DKK 1,150 (Page 1)

Rationale:
The focus is turning to weekly US Wegovy prescription data. The shares strengthened after Friday's 50,000+ reported prescriptions during the week: up 21% w-o-w. However, Novo has flagged that due to warehousing of patients ahead of the relaunch of Wegovy, it is difficult to make too much of the weekly data until late Q1, due to the stocking effects of patients. In mid-2023, the CV outcome trial SELECT will read out, which will also be crucial for the long-term potential of Wegovy. (Page 1)
